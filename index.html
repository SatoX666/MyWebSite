            For the first time when I started to really program, I was introduced to the program called Lazarus.

            Game Maker Studio 2 is a very simple and beautiful program for
            creating pixel games using a built-in programming language called game maker language which is basically
            pure English. Extremely easy to learn but very demanding in terms of organization, an excellent program
            and engine on which I first started doing my projects.

            Unreal Engine 4 is the game engine on which I started programming and
            working with 3D projects. I had a rather narrow responsibility, namely the design and reconstruction of
